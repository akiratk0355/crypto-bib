Moreover, he showed that, presumably, OAEP cannot be proven secure from the one-wayness of the underlying trapdoor permutation. This paper establishes another result on the security of OAEP. It proves that OAEP offers semantic security against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks, in the random oracle model, under the partial-domain one-wayness of the underlying permutation. Therefore, this uses a formally stronger assumption. Nevertheless, since partial-domain one-wayness of the RSA function is equivalent to its (full-domain) one-wayness, it follows that the security of RSA\textendash{}OAEP can actually be proven under the sole RSA assumption, although the reduction is not tight.},

  abstract = {Can you guarantee secrecy even if an adversary can eavesdrop on your brain? We consider the problem of protecting privacy in circuits, when faced with an adversary that can access a bounded number of wires in the circuit. This question is motivated by side channel attacks, which allow an adversary to gain partial access to the inner workings of hardware. Recent work has shown that side channel attacks pose a serious threat to cryptosystems implemented in embedded devices. In this paper, we develop theoretical foundations for security against side channels. In particular, we propose several ef\textsterling{}cient techniques for building private circuits resisting this type of attacks. We initiate a systematic study of the complexity of such private circuits, and in contrast to most prior work in this area provide a formal threat model and give proofs of security for our constructions.},

The algorithms are compact (using only x-coordinates), run in constant time with uniform execution patterns, and do not distinguish between the curve and its quadratic twist; they thus have a built-in measure of side-channel resistance. (For comparison, we also implement two faster but non-constant-time algorithms.) The core of our construction is a suite of two-dimensional differential addition chains driven by efficient endomorphism decompositions, built on curves selected from a family of $\mathbb{Q}$-curve reductions over 𝔽p2Fp2$\backslash$mathbb\{F\}\_\{p\^2\} with p = 2127 - 1. We include state-of-the-art experimental results for twist-secure, constant-time, x-coordinate-only scalar multiplication.},

Our purpose is to examine the role of cryptography in those two wars. Despite the far greater technological resources of their opponents, the communications intelligence specialists of the Vi\textasciicircum{}e.t Minh, the National Liberation Front, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had considerable success in both protecting Vietnamese communications and acquiring tactical and strategic secrets from the enemy. Perhaps surprisingly, in both wars there was a balance between the sides. Generally speaking, cryptographic knowledge and protocol design were at a high level at the central commands, but deployment for tactical communications in the field was difficult, and there were many failures on all sides.},

Our algorithms are based on an efficient Montgomery ladder scalar multiplication on the Kummer surface of Gaudry and Schost's genus-2 hyperelliptic curve, combined with the Jacobian point recovery technique of Chung, Costello, and Smith. Our results are the first to show the feasibility of software-only hyperelliptic cryptography on constrained platforms, and represent a significant improvement on the elliptic-curve state-of-the-art for both key exchange and signatures on these architectures. Notably, our key-exchange scalar-multiplication software runs in under 9520k cycles on the ATmega and under 2640k cycles on the Cortex M0, improving on the current speed records by 32 \% and 75 \% respectively.},

We give a taxonomy of the best known techniques to realize genus 2 based cryptography, which includes fast formulas on the Kummer surface and efficient 4-dimensional GLV decompositions. By studying different modular arithmetic approaches on these curves, we present a range of genus 2 implementations. On a single core of an Intel Core i7-3520M (Ivy Bridge), our implementation on the Kummer surface breaks the 120 thousand cycle barrier which sets a new software speed record at the 128-bit security level for constant-time scalar multiplications compared to all previous genus 1 and genus 2 implementations.},

One of our transforms has the added advantage of producing signatures shorter than produced by the Fiat-Shamir transform. Reduction tightness is important because it allows the implemented scheme to use small parameters (thereby being as efficient as possible) while retaining provable security.},

If the identification scheme is random selfreducible and satisfies the weakest possible security notion (hardness of key-recoverability), then the signature scheme obtained via Fiat-Shamir is unforgeable against chosen-message attacks in the multi-user setting. Our security reduction is in the random oracle model and loses a factor of roughly Qh, the number of hash queries. Previous reductions incorporated an additional multiplicative loss of N , the number of users in the system. Our analysis is done in small steps via intermediate security notions, and all our implications have relatively simple proofs. Furthermore, for each step, we show the optimality of the given reduction in terms of model assumptions and tightness.},

In classical cryptography, Fiat-Shamir is a zero-knowledge proof of knowledge assuming that the underlying sigma-protocol has the zero-knowledge and special soundness properties. Unfortunately, Ambainis, Rosmanis, and Unruh (FOCS 2014) ruled out nonrelativizing proofs under those conditions in the quantum setting. In this paper, we show under which strengthened conditions the Fiat-Shamir proof system is still post-quantum secure. Namely, we show that if we require the sigma-protocol to have computational zero-knowledge and statistical soundness, then Fiat-Shamir is a zero-knowledge simulation-sound proof system (but not a proof of knowledge!). Furthermore, we show that Fiat-Shamir leads to a post-quantum secure unforgeable signature scheme when additionally assuming a ``dual-mode hard instance generator'' for generating key pairs.},

  abstract = {The Schnorr signature scheme is the most efficient signature scheme based on the discrete logarithm problem and a long line of research investigates the existence of a tight security reduction for this scheme in the random oracle model. Almost all recent works present lower tightness bounds and most recently Seurin (Eurocrypt 2012) showed that under certain assumptions the non-tight security proof for Schnorr signatures in the random oracle by Pointcheval and Stern (Eurocrypt 1996) is essentially optimal. All previous works in this direction rule out tight reductions from the (onemore) discrete logarithm problem. In this paper we introduce a new meta-reduction technique, which shows lower bounds for the large and very natural class of generic reductions. A generic reduction is independent of a particular representation of group elements and most reductions in state-of-the-art security proofs have this desirable property. Our approach shows unconditionally that there is no tight generic reduction from any natural non-interactive computational problem $\Pi$ defined over algebraic groups to breaking Schnorr signatures, unless solving $\Pi$ is easy.},

  abstract = {In a traditional signature scheme, a signature $\sigma$ on a message m is issued under a public key PK, and can be interpreted as follows: ``The owner of the public key PK and its corresponding secret key has signed message m.'' In this paper we consider schemes that allow one to issue signatures on behalf of any NP statement, that can be interpreted as follows: ``A person in possession of a witness w to the statement that x $\in$L has signed message m.'' We refer to such schemes as signatures of knowledge.We formally define the notion of a signature of knowledge. We begin by extending the traditional definition of digital signature schemes, captured by Canetti's ideal signing functionality, to the case of signatures of knowledge. We then give an alternative definition in terms of games that also seems to capture the necessary properties one may expect from a signature of knowledge. We then gain additional confidence in our two definitions by proving them equivalent.We construct signatures of knowledge under standard complexity assumptions in the common-random-string model.We then extend our definition to allow signatures of knowledge to be nested i.e., a signature of knowledge (or another accepting input to a UC-realizable ideal functionality) can itself serve as a witness for another signature of knowledge. Thus, as a corollary, we obtain the first delegatable anonymous credential system, i.e., a system in which one can use one's anonymous credentials as a secret key for issuing anonymous credentials to others.},

  abstract = {For over two decades, timing attacks have been an active area of research within applied cryptography. These attacks exploit cryptosystem or protocol implementations that do not run in constant time. When implementing an elliptic curve cryptosystem with a goal to provide side-channel resistance, the scalar multiplication routine is a critical component. In such instances, one attractive method often suggested in the literature is Montgomery's ladder that performs a fixed sequence of curve and field operations. This paper describes a timing attack vulnerability in OpenSSL's ladder implementation for curves over binary fields. We use this vulnerability to steal the private key of a TLS server where the server authenticates with ECDSA signatures. Using the timing of the exchanged messages, the messages themselves, and the signatures, we mount a lattice attack that recovers the private key. Finally, we describe and implement an effective countermeasure.},

  abstract = {We design and implement a simple zero-knowledge argument protocol for NP whose communication complexity is proportional to the square-root of the verification circuit size. The protocol can be based on any collision-resistant hash function. Alternatively, it can be made non-interactive in the random oracle model, yielding concretely efficient zk-SNARKs that do not require a trusted setup or public-key cryptography. Our protocol is attractive not only for very large verification circuits but also for moderately large circuits that arise in applications. For instance, for verifying a SHA-256 preimage in zero-knowledge with 2-40 soundness error, the communication complexity is roughly 44KB (or less than 34KB under a plausible conjecture), the prover running time is 140 ms, and the verifier running time is 62 ms. This proof is roughly 4 times shorter than a similar proof of ZKB++ (Chase et al., CCS 2017), an optimized variant of ZKBoo (Giacomelli et al., USENIX 2016). The communication complexity of our protocol is independent of the circuit structure and depends only on the number of gates. For 2-40 soundness error, the communication becomes smaller than the circuit size for circuits containing roughly 3 million gates or more. Our efficiency advantages become even bigger in an amortized setting, where several instances need to be proven simultaneously. Our zero-knowledge protocol is obtained by applying an optimized version of the general transformation of Ishai et al. (STOC 2007) to a variant of the protocol for secure multiparty computation of Damgard and Ishai (Crypto 2006). It can be viewed as a simple zero-knowledge interactive PCP based on "interleaved" Reed-Solomon codes.},

  isbn = {978-3-319-44618-9},
  abstract = {The Fiat\textendash{}Shamir (FS) transformation (Fiat and Shamir, Crypto '86) is a popular paradigm for constructing very efficient non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) arguments and signature schemes using a hash function, starting from any three-move interactive protocol satisfying certain properties. Despite its wide-spread applicability both in theory and in practice, the known positive results for proving security of the FS paradigm are in the random oracle model, i.e., they assume that the hash function is modelled as an external random function accessible to all parties. On the other hand, a sequence of negative results shows that for certain classes of interactive protocols, the FS transform cannot be instantiated in the standard model.We initiate the study of complementary positive results, namely, studying classes of interactive protocols where the FS transform does have standard-model instantiations. In particular, we show that for a class of ``highly sound'' protocols that we define, instantiating the FS transform via a q-wise independent hash function yields NIZK arguments and secure signature schemes. For NIZK, we obtain a weaker ``q-bounded'' zero-knowledge flavor where the simulator works for all adversaries asking an a-priori bounded number of queries q; for signatures, we obtain the weaker notion of random-message unforgeability against q-bounded random message attacks.Our main idea is that when the protocol is highly sound, then instead of using random-oracle programming, one can use complexity leveraging. The question is whether such highly sound protocols exist and if so, which protocols lie in this class. We answer this question in the affirmative in the common reference string (CRS) model and under strong assumptions. Namely, assuming indistinguishability obfuscation and puncturable pseudorandom functions we construct a compiler that transforms any 3-move interactive protocol with instance-independent commitments and simulators (a property satisfied by the Lapidot-Shamir protocol, Crypto '90) into a compiled protocol in the CRS model that is highly sound. We also present a second compiler, in order to be able to start from a larger class of protocols, which only requires instance-independent commitments (a property for example satisfied by the classical protocol for quadratic residuosity due to Blum, Crypto '81). For the second compiler we require dual-mode commitments.We hope that our work inspires more research on classes of (efficient) 3-move protocols where Fiat\textendash{}Shamir is (efficiently) instantiable.},

By using a pseudo-random function it is possible to convert arbitrary many bit values from one initial random replicated share. Furthermore, we generalize the conversion to handle general values of a bounded size.},

This problem has many applications for online collaboration. In this work, we present protocols based on the use of homomorphic encryption and different hashing schemes for both the semi-honest and malicious environments. The protocol for the semi-honest environment is secure in the standard model, while the protocol for the malicious environment is secure in the random oracle model. Our protocols obtain linear communication and computation overhead. We further implement different variants of our semi-honest protocol. Our experiments show that the asymptotic overhead of the protocol is affected by different constants. (In particular, the degree of the polynomials evaluated by the protocol matters less than the number of polynomials that are evaluated.) As a result, the protocol variant with the best asymptotic overhead is not necessarily preferable for inputs of reasonable size.},

We perform internet-wide scans for TLS on a large number of ports, as well as SSH and IPsec to measure elliptic curve support and implementation behaviors, and collect passive measurements of client curve support for TLS. We also perform active measurements to estimate server vulnerability to known attacks against elliptic curve implementations, including support for weak curves, invalid curve attacks, and curve twist attacks. We estimate that 1.53\% of HTTPS hosts, 0.04\% of SSH hosts, and 4.04\% of IKEv2 hosts that support elliptic curves do not perform curve validity checks as specified in elliptic curve standards. We describe how such vulnerabilities could be used to construct an elliptic curve parameter downgrade attack called CurveSwap for TLS, and observe that there do not appear to be combinations of weak behaviors we examined enabling a feasible CurveSwap attack in the wild. We also analyze source code for elliptic curve implementations, and find that a number of libraries fail to perform point validation for JSON Web Encryption, and find a flaw in the Java and NSS multiplication algorithms.},
